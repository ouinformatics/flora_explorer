	<br>
	<p>Botanists and Ecologists in North America have a rich tradition of writing Floras, or lists of vascular plants. The potential of using these floras as baselines for understanding patterns of,
		and threats to, modern biodiversity cannot be overstated. Nevertheless, floristic work is often published in obscure sources and is very difficult for biodiversity stakeholders to obtain. Although
		information technology and data transfer amongst scientists are both growing by leaps and bounds, floras are largely confined to dusty shelves.</p>

	<p>Imagine how biodiversity research could be facilitated if there was a georeferenced, easily accessible database that allows scientists to access raw floristic data from thousands of locations
		at many orders of magnitude of spatial scale and over time spans of decades. Although this might not be considered a high-tech 'sensor', it would allow us to ask basic macroecological questions as
		well as vital applied concerns. If integrated with current biotic inventories, it could be a part of a continent-wide 'biodiversity observatory'.</p>

	<h3>Goals of the Floras of North America Project</h3>

	<p>
		1) <i>Assemble a bibliography of floristic work</i>. This bibliography will be of great value to botanists beginning new work, and will eventually be able to be queried geographically. For example,
		one could ask:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Has a flora ever been written for this location?</li>
		<li>What is the most recent flora written for an area within 50km of here?</li>
		<li>What are the best, and least well-studied parts of the continent?</li>
		<li>Who is the most prolific botanist in writing floras?</li>
		<li>How many state parks in my state have been studied floristically?</li>
		<li>What is the oldest floristic work in my region?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		2) <i>Develop predictive models for species richness</i>. We are using our data set to develop regression models to predict how many species 'should' occur in a given region. Using such models as a
		standard, we can evaluate whether a region of interest is particularly rich or poor in species. This can be used to prioritize areas for conservation, or to identify areas that may have been
		inadequately explored. We also plan to use such predictive models to map patterns of the diversity of vascular plants in North America.
	</p>

	<p>
		3) <i>Address basic questions in macroecology</i>. A number of interesting questions have frequented the pages of ecology and biogeography journals recently, that can be readily tested using our
		data set. For example: - Is the species-area curve triphasic? - Is the latitudinal gradient more closely linked to climatic or historic factors? (e.g. time since last glaciation) - Are patterns of
		species richness scale-dependent? - Do different levels in the taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. subspecies, species, genera, families) behave similarly?
	</p>

	<p>
		4) <i>Understand patterns of exotic invasion</i>. Exotic species are not randomly distributed throughout the continent. We plan to use our data set to map patterns of exotic diversity, and to
		determine the degree to which it is correlated with native diversity. We also plan to assess other correlates of exotic diversity, including those related to human impact. We can also use our
		predictive models to identify regions that are relatively pristine with respect to exotic invaders.
